    "description":"ThunderScan is a SAST (Static Application Security Testing, WhiteBox Testing) answer for performing broad security reviews of utilization source code. ThunderScan is anything but difficult to utilize, requires no client include and can be sent during or after advancement. It is a productive option in contrast to the requesting and tedious strategy of manual code surveys. ThunderScan performs quick and exact examinations of enormous and complex source code ventures conveying exact outcomes and low bogus positive rate.   ThunderScan is intended to perform complete security appraisal of work area, web and portable application source code and it has over and again demonstrated its viability by finding basic vulnerabilities in well known open source applications.   Bolstered Languages\/Platforms:   ThunderScan examines for in excess of 30 helplessness types (counting OWASP Top 10) in work area, web and versatile applications created on different stages utilizing distinctive improvement situations and systems. A portion of these are recorded underneath:   Vulnerabilities:   SQL Injection   XPATH Injection   Document Disclosure   Mail Relay   Page Inclusion   Perilous Configuration Settings   Code Injection   Perilous File Extensions   Shell Command Execution   Misc. Perilous Functions   Cross Site Scripting   Discretionary Server Connection   Feeble Encryption   HTTP Response Splitting   Data Leaks   LDAP Injection   It took a week or so to get essential filtering taking a shot at the Macintosh, and afterward a couple of more days to render the dark scale information with Bill's altered Floyd-Steinberg vacillating. In the wake of shaking out an assortment of issues, for the most part including synchronization between the printer and the product, I was astonished and intrigued by the steady high caliber of the outcomes. I experienced a short, thrilled period of checking each picture in locate that would fit through the printer, just to perceive how things being what they are.   One significant structure choice that I made at an early stage was to keep the dark scale information around, to permit progressively adaptable picture handling. Thunderscan archives were five bits for every pixel, before the Macintosh by and large upheld dim scale, and the client could control the complexity and brilliance of chose zones of the picture, evading and consuming to uncover detail in the caught picture. This likewise paid off in later forms when we executed dim scale printing for Postscript printers.   My preferred component that I thought of for Thunderscan had to do with two dimensional looking over. Thunderscan records could be very enormous, so you could just show a segment of them in the picture zone of the window. You could look over the picture by hauling with a MacPaint-style \"hand\" looking over instrument, however you needed to drag a horrendous part to get to the limits of an enormous picture. I chose to include what I called \"inertial\" looking over, where you gave the picture a push and it continued looking at a variable speed toward the push, after the mouse button was discharged. I needed to add some hysteresis to prevent the picture from moving inadvertently, and make different changes, however soon I made them work and it felt extraordinary to have the option to dash around enormous pictures by pushing them.
