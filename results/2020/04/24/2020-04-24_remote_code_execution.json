    "description":"Testing the segments of implanted frameworks is regularly an exceptionally mind boggling process. It requires significant learning of the qualities of the gadgets and stage. Alongside exceptionally gifted test engineers, complex test labs are basic. The testing procedure is genuinely nitty gritty including countless test groupings.   Menlopark Technologies has an installed testing group with exceptionally gifted test engineers. We have executed complex ventures by rapidly adjusting to the test arrangements and utilitarian learning.   We have executed complex undertakings by rapidly adjusting to the test arrangements and utilitarian information.   Wide exhibit of inserted testing administrations crosswise over Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS), improvement stages and programming dialects   Exceptionally gifted group of specialists to do the complex inserted testing forms   Broad involvement with redistributing of inserted programming QA work   Comprehensive Approach - Service incorporates code surveys, documentation and code support   Probably the best challenge confronting semiconductor makers today is accomplishing satisfactory item quality levels while limiting raising test costs. Inserted testing is considered as the most effective testing programs accessible in the market for programming testing. Testing the parts of implanted frameworks is frequently an extremely mind boggling process. It requires significant learning of the qualities of the gadgets and stage. Alongside exceptionally talented test engineers, advanced test labs are fundamental. The implanted testing procedure is genuinely nitty gritty including countless test arrangements.   Fisherman has an inserted testing group with profoundly talented test engineers. We have executed complex ventures by rapidly adjusting to the test arrangements and useful learning. We give thorough testing administrations to implanted programming over a large group of objective gadgets, Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS), advancement stages and programming dialects. Our installed programming testing administrations incorporate code-level testing, just as inclusion investigation, useful testing, stress testing, code audit, troubleshooting and code upkeep.   How We can Help You?   Characterize test goals and practical testing procedure   Recognize implanted programming interfaces   Recognize information and yield flag over these interfaces   Recognize stage similarity testing prerequisites   Characterize manual experiments, test information and anticipated outcomes   Test execution, test the board and deformity goals   Create test bridle utilizing installed apparatuses and emulators for robotized testing   Test Metrics and announcing   A considerable lot of the implanted gadgets in the market need to experience extensive equipment and programming check cycles. This procedure is tedious and needs additional consideration to convey imperfection free item. Since manual testing is a mistake inclined and tedious action, we can't totally depend on it. It is untrustworthy for conveying imperfection free items in the evaluated time. It is especially significant and time basic when there are huge number of gadgets for creation.   Mechanized testing can enable us to accomplish this objective. Robotized testing instruments set aside time and cash of the seller to convey quality item on schedule.   Different mechanized apparatuses are accessible in the market; yet the greater part of them are space explicit and can't be tweaked. Aftek's TestJig is a convenient instrument. It gives a redid answer for dependably computerize the total testing cycle.   TestJig gives an answer for test inserted circuit sheets and the product on the sheets. This arrangement can be utilized for a wide range of testing including practical testing, relapse testing and burden testing.   Equipment testing chiefly manages the testing for generation. It includes the testing of equipment interfaces for creation go\/no-go. It likewise incorporates the testing of the finished result with programming running on it. TestJig is helpful for both creation go\/no-go testing and final result testing.   Highlights   Utilizing the TestJig arrangement, numerous loads up can be tried at the same time, it spares impressive check time. See the outline beneath. The Device Under Test (DUT) is associated with the Jig board through different interfaces. These Jig sheets are controlled from the focal server associated by means of wired or remote LAN.
