    "description":"As we all know the situation in the world is going on the pandemic crisis all over the world of covid 19 everyone is scared and everything is just shut down the offices, industries, shops, schools and colleges people are advised to stay home and stay safe from this problem the only solution is now to stay in home so this is the time to do some thing at home rather then sitting alone and doing nothing at home and getting depressed from this corona virus you can use this time to learn new things and upgrade your skills for better growth so there are online study programs which are provided by our institute and you can learn selenium with java online training by our Institute that provides software testing training courses and classes online and offline to our candidtes so candidates should know how important is testing for a project to know that everything which is done on the project is working or not and there will be no errors and if there are you need to solve them in the process also for that we use testing processes and tools to test and to solve .automation testing is also one of the testing Technique which we use. Automation testing is a Software testing technique to test and compare the actual output with the expected output. This can be achieved by writing test scripts or using any automation testing tool. Test automation is used to automate repetitive tasks and other testing tasks which are difficult to perform manually. The main goal of Automation testing is to increase efficiency and develop software value. Automation testing processes to test the application through any tool. Widely used automation testing tools are selenium & UFT (Unified functional testing). UFT is a licensed tool while selenium is open-source. Most of the start-up and mid-level organizations are using Selenium. Selenium got popular due to saving of License cost for the automation Tool. the industry is changing rapidly towards automation so in the current scenario, every tester required hands-on experience in selenium. Askme provides Online Automation testing training in Noida What is Selenium? Selenium is a free (open source) automated testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms. It is quite similar to HP Quick Test Pro (QTP now UFT) only that Selenium focuses on automating web-based applications. Testing done using the Selenium tool is usually referred to as Selenium Testing. Primarily, Selenium was created by Jason Huggins in 2004. An engineer at ThoughtWorks, he was working on a web application that required frequent testing. Having realized that the repetitious Manual Testing of their application was becoming more and more inefficient, he created a JavaScript program that would automatically control the browser's actions. He named this program as the \"JavaScriptTestRunner.\" What are Selenium Components? \u2022      Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE) \u2022      Selenium Remote Control (RC) \u2022      WebDriver  \u2022      Selenium Grid What is Selenium IDE Selenium IDE is a simple record and playback kind of tool which comes as an add-on for Mozilla Firefox only. Test cases written in IDE can be exported in many programming languages like Ruby, Java, C#, etc. Edit and Debug options along with records are also available. It is an excellent tool for beginners to understand the syntax of Selenium WebDriver.  What is Selenium RC Selenium RC (Remote Control) was the first tool of Selenium Suite. Earlier it was known as JavaScript Executor. RC was the tool that made Selenium famous in the market. It was the first tool that provided the support for multiple programming languages (JAVA, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Python, and C#). Selenium WebDriver: Selenium WebDriver is the most important tool of the Selenium suite. Because of the many limitations with RC, WebDriver was developed. It does not require any manual process like the Selenium Server. There is direct communication between code and browser. Features of Selenium WebDriver: l Open source l Supports all browsers like Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, etc. l Support Multiple languages like C#, JAVA, Ruby, Perl, Python, and PHP. l Supports multiple platforms like Linux, Windows, MAC, etc. l No middleman like Selenium RC server is required. Easy to remember API. What is selenium with java tool.? Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. ... It also provides a test domain-specific language (Selenese) to write tests in some popular programming languages, including C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Scala.  As I got a frequent question from students is it right automation will replace the manual tester job? Can I become an automation tester as I don\u2019t know to code? Where we can use the automation tool? or which is the best institute for selenium training or automation testing training? what is the selenium training cost To answer the above question Askme training Noida which provides the best Automation testing training in Noida and Delhi NCR Selenium with java training and the other answers are The Automation tool can\u2019t replace the manual tester job at all. We have to first stable the application functionality from Manual testing. Automation testing can\u2019t find the bug which we can find after testing the application manually and performing the different steps from our mind. Automation testing is not feasible for a short term project. Once application functionality is stable and every month build is going on live site then we can go for automation testing. Whenever any build is released to live site we have to make sure the existing functionality of the application is not affected due to new enhancement or bug fixes. We have a set of an important test case of a regression suite that is mandatory to run at least once before going live. To reduce the execution time cycle of regression testing we use automation testing. Yes, you need to learn to code to become an automation tester. We teach coding from basic to intermediate levels in a very effective and easy method. Our instructors are so confident that they can train to code any student whose analytical skill is good and ready to accept the challenge of the fear of coding. Askme offers Selenium with Python and Selenium with Java training in Noida courses. To start Selenium we first trained enough in coding in anyone of language i.e Python or Java then move into Selenium.that will help students to learn easily with this. Askme training is the best institute for automation testing training in Noida that provides Online software testing training courses and classes so you can learn selenium online that you don't need to get out of your home and learn from home and upgrade your skills and utilize this time for your benefits and well being also.",
