| Anonymous-ghost/AttackWebFrameworkTools | 本软件首先集成危害性较大框架和部分主流cms的rce(无需登录,或者登录绕过执行rce)和反序列化(利用链简单)。上传getshell。sql注入等高危漏洞直接就可以拿权限出数据。其次对一些构造复杂exp漏洞进行检测。傻瓜式导入url即可实现批量测试,能一键getshell检测绝不sql注入或者不是只检测。其中thinkphp 集成所有rce Exp Struts2漏洞集成了shack2 和k8 漏洞利用工具所有Exp并对他们的exp进行优化和修复此工具的所集成漏洞全部是基于平时实战中所得到的经验从而写入到 | https://github.com/Anonymous-ghost/AttackWebFrameworkTools | ['rce'] | 1 | 2021-08-25 06:22:36+00:00 | 287676 | 632 | | 118 | [] |
