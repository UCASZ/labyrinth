| ra4king/Ludum-Dare-30 | Entry to the Ludum Dare GameDev Competition where you make a game within 48 hours (working solo) or 72 hours (working solo or with a team). This entry is called Faction Wars and it's a a simple 4X game: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate | https://github.com/ra4king/Ludum-Dare-30 | ['exploit'] | 1 | 2014-12-10 08:48:04+00:00 | 520 | 1 | Java | 0 |
| zhaoxiahust/GPGPU-sim_MultiCore | In this project, I use pthread to parallel the simulation of GPGPU-sim. If you want to learn more detail information, you can find my paper "Exploiting Parallelism in the Simulation of GPGPU Program" | https://github.com/zhaoxiahust/GPGPU-sim_MultiCore | ['exploit'] | 1 | 2014-12-10 01:36:24+00:00 | 6472 | 1 | C++ | 0 |
| zhaoxiahust/GPGPU-sim_MultiNode | A version of GPGPU-sim that can use multiple compute nodes to accelerate its simulation speed. It can accelerate the simulation by a factor of up to 3.9 with a maximum error rate of 0.11\% on four simulation hosts. The detailed information is in "Exploiti | https://github.com/zhaoxiahust/GPGPU-sim_MultiNode | ['exploit'] | 1 | 2014-12-10 02:12:59+00:00 | 6492 | 0 | C++ | 0 |
