    "description":"In 1996, the \u201cRome Declaration on World Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action\u201d by FAO declared the access to adequate food is a human right where water for human consumption is considered as food too. Following that declaration, since the beginning of 21st century, policy debate on food vs. fuel has raised public demonstration throughout the world, particularly in Brazil, US and Europe due to the dilemma regarding farmland use changes by rising biofuel production which reinforce negatively the food supply. That worldwide concern regarding Water-Energy-Food nexus has led controversy within the existing international and regional legal systems such as policy harmonization debates between EU and her member states regarding water, food and energy domains even though food as a sub-domain of common agricultural policy was predominately a common concern at the EU level since its origin. Concurrently, in 2010, UN Resolution 64\/292 explicitly recognized human right to clean drinking water and German Federal Government initiated, for the first time as such, an on-line resource platform for Water-Energy-Food Security nexus funded by EU and in partnership with World Economic Forum, WEF and IFPRI. Subsequently Bonn Conference 2011 on \u2018The water Energy Food Security Nexus \u2013 Solutions for the Green Economy\u2019 recognized the nexus perspective and provided the guiding principles for the nexus which drawn outstanding policy discourse in the UN Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio 2012. Consecutively, in 2012, US National Intelligence Council published their report on \u2018Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds\u2019, where the nexus is declared as the fourth out of five most emerging global trends. Since then, subsequently, many governments like US, Germany, Brazil etc. as well as regional and international organizations like EU, UNWater and OECD have started policy discourse on how to recognize nexus and manage nexus resources using innovation and technology while there is no legal definition of such nexus. Very recently, on 25 September 2015, UN Resolution 70\/1 on \u2018Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u2019 declared 17 sustainable development goals where goal 2, 6, and 7 deals with food, water and energy security respectively. In addition, paragraph 16 of the said Resolution explicitly specified the need to bridge digital divide and to develop knowledge society using ICT as a means. This utterance of the said UN Resolution is coherent with the EU Decision 456\/2005\/EC which clearly emphasised to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable. However, in the case of nexus, following major problems are not in favour of implementing mentioned UN Resolution and EU Decision - ",
